                    <p>Imelda Cajipe-Endaya is one of the famous Contemporary Filipino Artist who also became a main figure for Filipino feminist and national liberation movements in Philippine Arts. Her artwork "Pasyong Bayan" (A Nation’s Passion) showed the adversities of women, as well as a protest of human rights against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. I personally believe that her artworks aim to give awareness and also a wake up call at the time during the martial law of how important human rights are and how without it, people would suffer and their freedom and rights will be violated. It is also to encourage and promote female artists as part of their mission as a group. It also addresses the needs of the community. </p>

                    <p>"Amongst the Lost People" is an artwork created by Annie Cabigting a Filipino Asian Modern and Contemporary painter in the year 2015. The artwork depicts a woman examining a painting that represents the 8th circle of hell, based on the famous novel "The Inferno" by Dante Alighieri. Personally, this painting can serve as a reminder for us to unwind from the tiring work from our daily lives. Remind us to always rethink our choices and actions in life to avoid being sinned against and sent to hell. Socially, politically, and spiritually, we must be kind and never be opportunistic toward fragile people.</p>

                        painter best known for his distinctive use of figurative expressionism. He rose to prominence
