                    <p>Imelda Cajipe-Endaya is one of the famous Contemporary Filipino Artist who also became a main figure for Filipino feminist and national liberation movements in Philippine Arts. Her artwork "Pasyong Bayan" (A Nation’s Passion) showed the adversities of women, as well as a protest of human rights against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. I personally believe that her artworks aim to give awareness and also a wake up call at the time during the martial law of how important human rights are and how without it, people would suffer and their freedom and rights will be violated. It is also to encourage and promote female artists as part of their mission as a group. It also addresses the needs of the community. </p>

                    <p>"Amongst the Lost People" is an artwork created by Annie Cabigting a Filipino Asian Modern and Contemporary painter in the year 2015. The artwork depicts a woman examining a painting that represents the 8th circle of hell, based on the famous novel "The Inferno" by Dante Alighieri. Personally, this painting can serve as a reminder for us to unwind from the tiring work from our daily lives. Remind us to always rethink our choices and actions in life to avoid being sinned against and sent to hell. Socially, politically, and spiritually, we must be kind and never be opportunistic toward fragile people.</p>

To depict scenes of utter chaos, Ventura draws inspiration from popular comic book characters, science fiction, Western history, Asian mythology, and Catholicism.

                    <p>Spoliarium – It is a popular song by the band "Eraserheads," which released in 1997 with the album
                        "Sticker Happy." Because of the song's rumor-related content and hidden message, it attracted
                        controversy when it was first released. They claim that Pepsi Paloma, a well-known actress from the
                        1980s, was involved. The article claims that Ricardo "Richie D'Horsie" Reyes, Joey de Leon, and Vic
                        Sotto were the three hosts who sexually abused Pepsi Paloma. When "Tito Sotto" got involved and
                        compelled Paloma to drop her accusations against the hosts, the situation heated up. Pepsi Paloma
                        committed suicide in 1985, at the age of 18. Decades passed, Ely Buendia, front man of E-heads,
                        revealed the true meaning of the song. He said that there’s no such connections as people believed. It
                        is all about getting pissed drank nothing more. He added that this myth of the song will continue
                        even he talks about it.</p>

                        band Orange and Lemons. It serves as Pinoy Big Brother's main theme song and the foundation for a
                        large portion of the musical scoring used in the reality series. The major motto of "Pinoy Ako" is
                        "Pagpapakatotoo”. The song also aims to inspire Filipinos to be proud of and true to themselves
                        despite their origins, where they live, and the difficulties they encounter. It demonstrates how a
                        Filipino can bravely represent the Philippines to the world by being true to who they are and not
                        living up to others' expectations. As stated by Clem Castro, the band's goal has always been to create
                        "timeless" music. The music they have created, with its memorable lyrics that preserve their music
                        as memories, is for future generations to hear.</p>

                        awards and most of them are from the 23rd Music Awards. It is a message from politics especially
                        that owns a prestigious chair. It also discusses the Philippines' situation in the face of corruption,
                        political dynasty, and poverty. The lyrics freely convey the harsh reality and the authorities' greed
                        for power, are what made it so potent. Gloc 9 concluded the song with a well-known Filipino proverb
                        that included a message for the offended party.</p>
